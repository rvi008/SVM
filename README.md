# TP SVM

## Question 1
We load the Iris Dataset and train a simple Linear Kernel SVM.
The fiting score is 66%.
We get a cross validated score of 72% +/-16% accuracy.

## Question 2
We now train a polynomial kernel SVM and get a fiting score of 72% (better) but the  cross validated score is 72% +/- 16%. No improvement

## Question 3
